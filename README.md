### Welcome to Thu's GitHub :four_leaf_clover:

My name is Thu Dang (pronounced like 'too dang') and I am a data enthusiast ‚ù£Ô∏è

üî≠ I'm currently an Analytics Engineer at Lucid Software. Before that, I graduated Summa Cum Laude from Macalester College with a BA in Applied Mathematics and Statistics. 

üå± Before embarking on my new journey as an Analytics Engineer, I've been working in different data capacities: 
-   :sparkles: Spring 2023: Data Science Intern in the Analytics Engineering team at Sezzle
-   :sparkles: Summer 2022: Data Science Intern at an NYC-based startup called Up&Up - a Series B tech-enabled real estate startup that helps renters build wealth like owners, backed by Founders Fund, Khosla Ventures, and strategic angels from Opendoor, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, and Millennium
- 	:sparkles: 2021: Summer Analytics Consultant at Deloitte Consulting in Singapore
- 	:sparkles: 2021: Case Team Assistant at Boston Consulting Group (BCG)
- 	:sparkles: 2020: Data Analytics Intern at MoMo, a tech unicorn in Vietnam
- 	:sparkles: 2019: Strategy and Insights Intern at Mindshare, a leading global media agency 

:mag: As I discover my passion in the intersection of business and data analytics, I would love to combine my skills in these fields in order to deliver data-driven insights for business problems.

:bulb: I am well-versed in R, Python, SQL (BigQuery), and DataStudio. During Deloitte, I also get acquainted with Google Cloud Platform and its services, including Cloud Run, Workflows, and BigQuery. At Up&Up, I gained more knowledge in Retool - a website building service - and different visualization platforms such as Mode and Metabase.

‚ö° Fun fact: 
1. Out of all the English books sold in Vietnam, I can tell whether a book is published in the US or UK just from its smell. 
2. At 16, I left Vietnam to study in India and shaved my head for the first time to donate hair to cancer patients.
