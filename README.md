### Welcome to Thu's GitHub :four_leaf_clover:

My name is Thu Dang (pronounced like 'too dang') and I am an aspiring analytic consultant.

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently a Summer Analytics Consultant at Deloitte Consulting in Singapore.
- ðŸŒ± I am also a rising junior at Macalester College in Minnesota, studying Applied Mathematics & Statistics (major), Computer Science (minor), and Community & Global Health (concentration).
- :dart: Before Deloitte, I have challenged myself in various scopes of work, ranging from strategy, consulting, and data analytics, and also in different industries. Some of my milestones are:
- 	:sparkles: 2019: Strategy and Insights Intern at Mindshare, a leading global media agency 
- 	:sparkles: 2020: Data Analytics Intern at MoMo, a leading fintech company in Vietnam
- 	:sparkles: 2021: Case Team Assistant at Boston Consulting Group (BCG)
- :mag: As I discover my passion in the business aspects of consulting as well as the analytical mindset in data analytics, I would love to combine these in the prospects of delivering data-driven insights for business problems.
- :bulb: I am well-versed in R, Python, SQL (BigQuery), and DataStudio. During Deloitte, I also get acquainted with Google Cloud Platform and its services, including Cloud Run, Workflows, and BigQuery.

- âš¡ Fun fact: 
1. Out of all the English books sold in Vietnam, I can tell whether a book is published in the US or UK just from its smell. 
2. At 16, I left Vietnam to study in India and shaved my head for the first time to donate hair to cancer patients.
